## Developing for dc-integration-middleware

Thanks for your interest! We welcome changes of all sizes, from improving existing integrations to adding entirely new ones.
Please consider these guidelines when filing a pull request:

*  Tab indentation.
*  Features and bug fixes should be covered by test cases.
*  Follow styling from eslint config. The easiest way to do this is by using an eslint highlighting plugin.
*  JSDoc comments for all methods.

Pull Requests will be reviewed by internal Amplience team members. Generally, these are merged after two approvals.

To get started, see [Develop Locally](./docs/dev/develop-locally.md).

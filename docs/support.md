# Support
This project is built as open source which you are free to use as a basis for your implementation. As such this application DOES NOT come with a warranty/support. We are not responsible for the outcome of this integration over time.

Whilst fully functional, there are some considerations that you may want to consider for production use cases:

## Source Control
When using this middleware, we suggest that you point to your own fork of this repository so that your are in full control. You can also chose to pull / merge updates into your fork and go through your own testing procedures.

## Watch
We would recommend that you watch this repository so that you can get notified of updates and releases.

## Customisation
We expect customers/partners/developers to extend the functionality to for their requirements.

Whilst we will endeavour to maintain and keep up to date, we always recommend that production use cases are owned by the customer so that they are in full control.

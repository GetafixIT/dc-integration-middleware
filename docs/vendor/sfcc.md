### Configuration

```json
{
   "vendor": "sfcc",
   "codec_params": {
      "api_url": "<sfcc api url>",
      "auth_url": "<sfcc auth url>",
      "site_id": "<sfcc site id>",
      "client_id": "<sfcc client id>",
      "client_secret": "<sfcc site secret>"
   }
}
```

## Configuration on the vendor side

The SFCC implementation makes OCAPI calls to an SFCC instance.

In order to allow dc-demostore-integration to access the Open Commerce API (OCAPI) on your Salesforce instance, create a new API client and add the client ID to this field. You can add a new API Client from the SFCC Account Manager.

When you create an API Client in the SFCC Account Manager, you will also specify an API Secret. See the [Setting up a Client ID](https://amplience.com/developers/docs/integrations/commerce/salesforce/setup/#ocapi-set-up) in SFCC section for more details.

As such, you'll need to edit the OCAPI settings, which can me found in Business Manager at Administration > Site Development > OCAPI Settings. These settings also handle whitelisting any URLs in the `allowed_origins` array.

> NOTE: The OCAPI endpoints in the following `resources` array covers the methods currently implemented by dc-demostore-integration. Additional methods may require adding additional resources in the OCAPI settings.
